                <li>Your objective is to prompt a GPT-based chatbot to say the three words listed in the sidebar, using as few messages as possible. However, the words can appear within other words</li>
                <li>Each message you send should not exceed 60 characters.</li>
                <li>The chatbot is told to avoid simply parroting synonyms or combining two words from your messages, but its responses can be unpredictable.</li>
                <li>In the sidebar, a ‚ùå next to a word means that the chatbot hasn't said it yet. A ‚úÖ means the chatbot used that word in its last response, and a üü° means the chatbot has used the word before, but not in the most recent message.</li>
                <li>Your ultimate goal is to get the chatbot to use all three words in a single response. However, this can be challenging, so don't hesitate to share your results even if it takes multiple messages to get all three words.</li>
                <li>Keep in mind that the chatbot's responses will generally be brief and you are capped at 10 responses, so plan your messages accordingly.</li>
